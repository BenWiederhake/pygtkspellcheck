PyGtkSpellCheck
===============
PyGtkSpellCheck is a spellchecking library written in pure Python for Gtk based on Enchant.
It works with PyGObject and PyGtk and of course with Python 2 and 3 (automatic switching).
I wrote this because there was no spellchecking library for Python 3 and PyGObject before.
For automatic translation of the user interface it can use GEdit's translation files.
